            Python is a general purpose interpreted, interactive,
            object-oriented and high-level programming language. It was created
            by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code
            is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
          </p>
          <p>
            Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new
            features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support
            for Unicode
          </p>
          <p>
            Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision
            of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Many of
            its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version
            series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which
            automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to
            Python 3
          </p>
          <p>
            My code examples will be a mixture of both versions (2 and 3).

            It is not a must to have any knowledge of programming before you
            start Python. Python for me is the preferred first programming
            language. I might be wrong or a bit bias because it was my first
            programming language, but it's not possible for several websites to
            be lying when they all say or imply that Python is easy to learn.
            What you do need is a device that you can run Python on. These days,
            even mobile phones have a Python app that can be used on them.
          </p>
          <p>
            You need to download the Python interpreter. I have the Python 3.7
            interpreter installed in my windows machine. I did not need to set
            any path in the environment variables. However, if yours was not set
            after installation, follow this

            As mentioned in the introduction, there are various versions of
            Python. However, these versions can be streamlined to be two:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Python 2</li>
            <li>Python 3</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            One major difference in the syntax of both versions has to do with
            the <code>print</code> keyword
          </p>
          <p>In Python 2</p>
          <code>
            print "Hello, Benedict"
          </code>

          <p>In Python 3</p>
          <code>
            print("Hello, Benedict")
          </code>

          <p>

          <p>
            The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C and Java.
            However, there are definite differences between the languages
          </p>
          <p>
            Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is
            visually uncluttered and it uses English keywords where other
            languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not
            use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after
            statements are optional. I will pick out a few of the syntactic
            details that stand out and talk briefly on them.
          </p>
          <header><h1>Indentation and Escape sequences</h1></header>
          <p>
            Python uses whitespace indentaton, rather than curly user brackets
            to delimit blocks An increase in indentation comes after certain
            statements, e.g nested statements; a decrease in indentation
            signifies the end of the current block.
          </p>
          <pre>
            def add_three(x):
              sum = x + 3
              if (x.isnumeric()):
                print(sum)
              else:
                print("Please enter a number")
          </pre>

          <p>
            Python emphasises readability and clean code. Escape sequences also
            help in this regard. Python's interaction with users is also
            commendable. Using the <code>input</code> keyword, data can be
            collected from users. For this data to be entered on a new line,
            Python provides a code for that.
          </p>
          <pre>
            input('Please enter your name: \n')
          </pre>
          <p>result:</p>
          <pre>
            Please enter your name:
            *cursor*
          </pre>

          <header><h1>Quotation and Comments in Python</h1></header>
          <p>
            A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal begins a
            comment. All characters after the # and up to the end of the
            physical line are part of the comment and the Python interpreter
            ignores them.
          </p>

          <pre>
            #A comment 
            print("Showing comment")
          </pre>

          <p>
            Python accepts both single (') and double (") quotation marks.
            However, as with other languages If you are starting an expression
            with a single quotation mark, kindly finish it with a single
            quotation mark, else, the interpreter will scream and point you
            precisely to your error. Another fun fact about the Python
            interpreter, the error messages are quite informative and detailed.

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables_and_Data_Types">
        <header><h1>Variables and Data Types</h1></header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Variables are reserved memory locations tos store values, like
            containers. This means that once you create a variable, you reserve
            some space in memory
          </p>
          <p>
            In Python, you do not need to create variables with a particular
            keyword, you simply go ahead and write the variable name and assign
            a value to it. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to
            variables in Python.
          </p>
          <pre>
            counter = 100        # An integer assignment 
            miles = 1000.0       # A floating-point assignment 
            name = "Benedict"    # A string assignment
          </pre>

          <p>
            There are exciting data types in Python, not so different from the
            normal data types in other languages. Python does have a soft spot
            for numbers. You will come across floating-point numbers and
            integers, both of the data type: number. To get the type of an
            element, simply do <code>type(element)</code>. Some of the data
            types in Python are listed below with examples
          </p>

          <pre>
            100                 # Integer
            1000.7              # Floating-Point number
            2+3j                # Complex
            'I am a string'     # String
            True                # Boolean
          </pre>

      <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Operators">
        <header><h1>Basic Operators</h1></header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Operators are constructs which can manipulate the value of
            operands.Operands are the elements involved in an expression or
            operation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the expression <code>4 + 5 = 9</code>. Here,
            <code>4</code> and <code>5</code> are called <em>operands</em> and
            <code>+</code> is called <em>operator</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several types of operators in Python. Below are some of
            these operators
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Arithmetic Operators: e.g Addition (+), Subtraction (-),

            </li>
            <li>
              Comparison Operators: e.g Equal (==), Not equal (!=), Less than
              (<), Greater than (>)
            </li>
            <li>

              Subtract and Assign (-=)
            </li>
            <li>
              Logical Operators: e.g Logical OR (or), Logical AND (and), Logical

        <article>
          <p>
            Decision making is anticipation of conditions occuring while
            executing a program and specifying actions to be taken according to
            these conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE
            or FALSE as outcome. An action is then decided according to the
            outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python uses <code>if...else</code> statements for decision making.
            This statement is quite powerful and makes a program dynamic.

            Generally, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement
            in a function is executed first, followed by the second and so on.
            Loops are for situations when you need a block of code to run

            A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to
            perform a single, related action. Functions provide better
            modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

            As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like
            print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. These
            functions are called user-defined functions.

             def add_three(x):
              sum = x + 3
              if (x.isnumeric()):    # Check if the value collected is a number
                print(sum)
              else:
                print("Please enter a number")
